html is used for designing the structre of webpage
css is used for designing the additional features or design of the structure.
these html and css are written in Vs code 
this are deployed in git and git hub mainly other are firebase,netify, bit bucket ,
GitLab.

what is git and GitHub: git is the one who tracks the code and GitHub stores and manage the code.
git is version control and git hub is a cloud storage.git is simple to learn.

how to use git: 1) install git-bash
2) either install vscode or write using cmd or by using a git-bash
3)to check if git is installed open gitbash and use command 'git --version'.

'git remote add origin' for establishing communication b/w cloud and local repo

https://github.com/sachinsamala/training.git

commands to add in local repo to cloud repo 
1) git init
2) git config --global user.name
3)git config --global user.mail
for connecting local repo to cloud repo command 'git remote add origin (origin path)'
for pulling files from any branch ex:main command is 'git pull origin main'
for converting untracked files to tracked files use command 'git add .' and next 'git commit -m "new-file"'
for pushing local rep files to cloud repo command: 


step 1: create a git-hub acc
step 2: created repo in a git-hub
step 3: open vs code and open terminal in vs code
step 4: init git in a local repo "git init"
step 5: configure user and email to local repo

	git config --global user.name ""
	git config --global user.email ""

step 6: add remote/cloud repo to local repo 
	git remote add origin http-path

step 7: git pull origin branch name(main)
step 8:convert untracked file to tracked files
	git add.
	git commit -m "message"
step 9:check status
	git status
step 10: push to cloud repo
	git push -u origin master(branch-main)

- Var is the 
- header part is the unvisible to the end user 
- body part is visible to the end user

What is Datatype?
-  datatypes is used to define what kind of data used in the variable.
- typeof() method is used for knowing the type of datatype

types: 1)primitive datatypes
- it can store single values.
- the values are immutable
they are: String , booloean , number , undefined , null , bigint , symbol.

2) non- primitive datatypes
- it can store multiple values.
- the values are mutable.
they are: class , objects , functions , arrays , math , date , json.

String : it store a sequence of characters stored within a double quotes / single quotes/ backticks(
ex: var username ="mahesh";
    let title  = 'super star'
	const 

Boolean : true/false

number : integers , float , decimal , exponential , etc...
  -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 values.

Comments in js:
1.single line commennt(//)
2.multi-line comment(/**/)

OPERATOR:
- Operators are special type of symbols used to perform operation on operands.
ex: 2 + 2

1)unary
2)binary
3)ternary (operand1 ? operand2 : operand3) used for if-else condition

1.1 arithmatic operators 
 - which performs operations like : addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,modulus,exponential,increment , decrement

1.2 assignment operators
 - additional assignment9(+=), subtration assignment(-=), multipicistion assignment(*=) , division assignment(/=), modulus assignmet(%=)

1.3 relational operators 
- boolean value will be the output. ==(only checks values not datatype);, ===(checks datatype also),!=(not equals to), !==(strictly not equal to)
- <(lessthan),>(greaterthan).

1.4 logical operators
- AND && , OR || , ! (OPPOSITE)
______________________________________________

loops:

if: 
- when only one condition is there.
- only works for false statments.

if-else:
- if is a true statments
- else is a false statments

else-if :
- 

//assignmet - write a condition to check greates among 3 numbers 
a=20;
b=30;
c-40;
using switch and if else.

looping statments:
- iterating the block of code multiple times.
1)for loop 
- syntax - for(initialization ; condition ; updation){statment}
2)while loop 
- syntax - while(condition){statment}
- minimum iteration count is "0"
3)do-while loop
- syntax: do{statment}
			while(condition)
- minimum iteration count is "1"

entry controlled loops: for loop , while loop(condition will be checked first then executed)
exit controlled loops : do-while loops. (first execution happens after that checks condition)

functions:-

- functions is a building block of javascripts.
-  function is a block of code which is used to execute speciific task.
- function is a non- primitive data type
- functions can be reusable

syntax: function function_name(optional parameter){ // functions del 

types of functions:
1. named functions- function is having a name and invoked(calling ) with 
2. anonymus functions - a function which doesnot have a name for it. and it cannot be executed by itself.
3. function expressions - an anonymus function body is assigned 
4.IIFE(immediate invoke function expression) - it can be called only once 
5.arrow functions - it is introduced in es6
- it reduces the normal function of the function, it is similar to anonymus function.
6.higher order  functions
7.callbackfunctions

Note - current version of javascript is es14
es- ecma script
ECMA - european computer manifacturing association.
- es6 feature is stable.
